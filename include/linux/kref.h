/**
 * kref_get_unless_zero - Increment refcount for object unless it is zero.
 * @kref: object.
 *
 * Return non-zero if the increment succeeded. Otherwise return 0.
 *
 * This function is intended to simplify locking around refcounting for
 * objects that can be looked up from a lookup structure, and which are
 * removed from that lookup structure in the object destructor.
 * Operations on such objects require at least a read lock around
 * lookup + kref_get, and a write lock around kref_put + remove from lookup
 * structure. Furthermore, RCU implementations become extremely tricky.
 * With a lookup followed by a kref_get_unless_zero *with return value check*
 * locking in the kref_put path can be deferred to the actual removal from
 * the lookup structure and RCU lookups become trivial.
